# py-simple-calculator

<p>I'm currently learning both python and docker. So I thought, it's a good idea to improve both of those skills by uploading the python projects I'm doing while learning, as docker images to docker hub. I'll add a description and a docker hub link to each image for anyone to check.</p>

Python Tutorial I'm following - <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8">Click me</a> <br>
Docker Tutorial I'm following - <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE&t=2s">Click me</a> <br>

Both are fantastic, <b>Highly recommend !</b>.<br>
